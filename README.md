Please find below coding test requirements

Use Android Splash screen Jetpack API to display splash screen for 10 secs and add check to verify if user already logged in or not.

If user logged in already redirect to home page else display login page .

 in Login page use material components for UI design with option to enter mobile no , once mobile entered validate the text entered and enable OTPview to input some text from user and upon empty text validation check redirect to home page.

In home page display 2 tabs Home & About  using Tablayout and Viewpager2

Use View model to load data in fragments and load data from json attached, if Home Tab is selected, display all data in recycler view with different view types based on contentType field like screenshot attached for each row another recyclerview need to be used with horizontal scrolling for each row .

Use card view and Constraint layout for layout part .  If value id is coming in content object use textview and display ID in the text view and for content type "CAROUSEL_AD" display Imageview in full width.

Note : Don't use hardcoded values in layouts designing , use Coroutines for background processing.
